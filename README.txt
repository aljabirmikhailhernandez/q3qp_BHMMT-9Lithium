Loading the website/program/grame will introduce you to the user interface. In this case, you are red and the opponent is blue.
To start the game, the game tells you to flip a coin. Flipping the coin will determine who gets to attack in the first turn.
If you win the coin flip, you get to attack the opponent first. If you lose, they get to attack you first.
After that turn, you are given the option to attack or defend. Attacking deals damage to the opponent while defending can protect you
from damage.
The one who gets their enemy's health down to 0 first wins the game.
Once the game is done, you can press the reset button to restart the game.
